abstract = {For several years now, scientists have been proposing numerous models for defining anything "as a service (aaS)", including discussions of products, processes, data {\&} information management, and security as a service. In this paper, based on a thorough literature survey, we investigate the vast stream of the state of the art in Everything as a Service (XaaS). We then use this investigation to explore an integrated view of XaaS that will help propose approaches for migrating applications to the cloud and exposing them as services.},

abstract = {The field of wireless sensor networks has produced a range of supporting hardware and software technologies that facilitate the creation of sensor network applications. Despite these advances, the implementation of wireless sensor network applications remains a complex task that requires domain experts and a significant investment of time and money. This level of investment is often infeasible for single applications, especially for those applications with a short life-cycle. This paper suggests a new direction in wireless sensor network research. We argue that next generation sensor network platforms should strive towards a shared infrastructure, multi-application paradigm, with a clean separation of concerns between infrastructure providers and application developers. These are principles that are well established in the field of Cloud Computing. This paper introduces our vision for future sensor networks, which we refer to as the 'Tangible Cloud'. To support this vision, we introduce a reference architecture and pricing model for sensor network resources.},

abstract = {Wireless grid is a wireless network based virtual system that consists of wireless-connected different types of electronic devices and computers. It has broad application prospects in e-learning, mobile e-business, modern healthcare, smart home, wireless sensor networks and disaster management. Wireless cloud is a natural extension of wireless grid. On the basis of a literature analysis, this paper gives a category on wireless grids, and discusses the concept, characteristics and architectures of wireless grids. Then it presents a review on the existing work, mainly focusing on the issues of communication technologies, middleware and applications. At the end, the paper analyzes the open issues and lists the main research directions in this field. The survey indicates that the wireless grid and cloud is a vibrant research area.},

The security problem of cloud computing is very important and it can prevent the rapid development of cloud computing. This paper introduces some cloud computing systems and analyzes cloud computing security problem and its strategy according to the cloud computing concepts and characters. The data privacy and service availability in cloud computing are the key security problem. Single security method cannot solve the cloud computing security problem and many traditional and new technologies and strategies must be used together for protecting the total cloud computing system.},

abstract = {With rapid development of sensor technologies and wireless network infrastructure, research and development of traffic related applications, such as real time traffic map and on-demand travel route recommendation have attracted much more attentions than ever before. Both archived and real-time data involved in these applications could potentially be very big, depending on the number of deployed sensors. Emerging Cloud infrastructure can elastically handle such big data and conveniently providing nearly unlimited computing and storage resources to hosted applications, to carry out analysis not only for long-term planning and decision making, but also analytics for near real-time decision support. In this paper, we propose Smart Traffic Cloud, a software infrastructure to enable traffic data acquisition, and manage, analyze and present the results in a flexible, scalable and secure manner using a Cloud platform. The proposed infrastructure handles distributed and parallel data management and analysis using ontology database and the popular Map-Reduce framework. We have prototyped the infrastructure in a commercial Cloud platform and we developed a real-time traffic condition map using data collected from commuters' mobile phones. © 2012 IEEE.},
